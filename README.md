# FreeCodeCamp calculator project
A simple calculator created with Reactjs. This was made specifically as part of a freeCodeCamp certification - Front End Development Libraries Developer Certification. In order to complete this certification, I needed to submit a few required projects, one of them being this calculator project.

## Project setup

### Download dependencies
Install all dependencies the project requires with this command:

```
yarn install
```

### Compile the project and run it (with hot-reload)
If you want to run the project and see how it looks, execute the following command and go to `http://localhost:1234` in the browser:

```
yarn start
```

### Compile and minify the project
This will generate a build folder called `dist` and build the app for production.

```
yarn build
```

Refer to the [official documentation](https://parceljs.org/getting-started/webapp/#project-setup) for more configuration options.
